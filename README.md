# Prime Numbers
This program studies prime numbers through determining prime numbers

# Finding The nth Prime Number
The method kthPrime searches for the 1st - 30 000th prime number in less than one minute from the infinite sequence of prime numbers.

Implementing the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" swiftly finds all the prime numbers within the time constraint.

# Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Start a the prime number 2 and eliminate all other multiples of 2, thus eliminating composite numbers

- Move on to 3 and elminate all other multiples of 3

- Move on to 5 and eliminate all other multiples of 5 etc...
