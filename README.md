# find-primes
This Java program searches for all prime numbers from 0 - 50 000 in less than one minute.

There are many algorithms for finding prime numbers, however this finds the most efficient algorithm through implementing the "Sieve of Eratosthenes"

# Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Start a the prime number 2 and eliminate all other multiples of 2

- Move on to 3 and elminate all other multiples of 3

- Move on to 5 and eliminate all other multiples of 5 etc...
