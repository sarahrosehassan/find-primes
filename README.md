# find-primes
This Java program searches for the 0 - 30 000th prime number in less than one minute.

There are many simple algorithms for finding prime numbers, however, this finds the most efficient algorithm through implementing the "Sieve of Eratosthenes"

# What is a Prime Number?
Prime numbers only have 2 factors 1 and the number itself. These factors perfectly divide a number without a remainder.


# Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Start a the prime number 2 and eliminate all other multiples of 2

- Move on to 3 and elminate all other multiples of 3

- Move on to 5 and eliminate all other multiples of 5 etc...
