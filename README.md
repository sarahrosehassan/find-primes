# A Study of Prime Numbers
This project studies prime numbers through finding algorithms to determine three requirements:
- establishing whether a number is prime
- returning the kth element from the infinite sequence of prime numbers
- returning the prime factors of a certain integer


# Finding The nth Prime Number
The method kthPrime searches for the 1st - 30 000th prime number in less than one minute from the infinite sequence of prime numbers.

Implementing the "Sieve of Eratosthenes" swiftly finds all the prime numbers within the time constraint.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

- Start a the prime number 2 and eliminate all other multiples of 2, thus eliminating composite numbers

- Move on to 3 and elminate all other multiples of 3

- Move on to 5 and eliminate all other multiples of 5 etc...
